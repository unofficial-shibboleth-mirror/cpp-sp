Version 1.0

Binary distributions of the Shibboleth code are available.
Information on obtaining and installing binaries can be found at
http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/ and in the deploy guide in this
directory.

This document provides details for those wishing to build from source.

C++ / TARGET

Your first step is going to be the OpenSAML INSTALL.txt file. Please read it
thoroughly to understand the issues. All the requirements in that file
apply, mainly because you need to build OpenSAML, and almost all the
dependencies are the same. Once you reach the end of that build process and
have some confidence it worked, you can come back and continue here.

You'll next need to get an Apache in place. If you're building from source,
you don't have to use the "real" Apache code, or use mod_ssl. You will
however need to provide the necessary build flags during configure, or
ideally, let our configure script use your Apache's apxs script to extract
the necessary information.

Once Apache is in place, you'll also need to build the libapreq library.
Adjust the include path as needed.

http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/libapreq/libapreq-1.1.tar.gz

$ tar xvzf libapreq-1.1.tar.gz
$ cd libapreq-1.1
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/shibboleth --enable-static=no \
    --with-apache-includes=/usr/local/apache/include
$ make
$ make install


Building the Shibboleth target libraries, shar, test programs, and Apache
modules is more or less like building OpenSAML. You can get the code from
CVS and run the bootstrap script if you want (remember to get new versions
of autoconf/autoheader if you're running old pre-1.5 autoconf stuff):

$ cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.internet2.edu:/home/cvs/shibboleth login
$ cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.internet2.edu:/home/cvs/shibboleth co -r Rel_1_0 shibboleth
$ cd shibboleth/c
$ ./bootstrap

With the source distribution or the results of your bootstrap:

$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/shibboleth --with-xmlsec=/opt/shibboleth --with-apxs -C
$ make
$ make install

This will build the Apache modules by extracting build settings from apxs.
The configure script will look in normal spots for the script
(/usr/bin/apxs, /usr/local/apache/bin/apxs) but you can point it if you need
to.

If you want to build the modules but not use apxs, you can use the
--without-apxs option, and provide flags using the APXS_PREFIX, APXS_CFLAGS,
APXS_INCLUDE, APXS_LIBEXEC, and APXS_SYSCONFDIR variables (see the apxs docs
for some guidance on what these should be).

To test your installation, you can try this:

$ set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/shibboleth/lib; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ cd /opt/shibboleth
$ bin/shibtest -d etc/shibboleth/ -h foo -q urn:mace:inqueue:example.edu \
    -r http://www.foo.edu/ -a http://wayf.internet2.edu/InQueue/AA

You should get some reasonably structured output back that lists some simple
attributes. An error here is a pretty good sign there's trouble.
