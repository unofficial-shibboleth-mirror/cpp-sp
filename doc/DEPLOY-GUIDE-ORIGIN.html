<h3><a name="1."></a>1. Shibboleth Overview</h3>
<p>Shibboleth is a system designed to exchange attributes across realms for the 
primary purpose of authorization. It provides a secure framework for one 
organization to transmit attributes about a web-browsing individual across 
security domains to another institution. In the primary usage case, when a user 
attempts to access a resource at a remote domain, the user&#39;s own home security 
domain can send certain information about that user to the target site in a 
trusted exchange. These attributes can then be used by the resource to help 
determine whether to grant the user access to the resource. The user may have 
the ability to decide whether to release specific attributes to certain sites by 
specifying personal Attribute Release Policies (ARP&#39;s), effectively preserving 
privacy while still granting access based on trusted information.</p>
<p>When a user first tries to access a resource protected by Shibboleth, they 
are redirected to a service which asks the user to specify the organization from 
which they want to authenticate. If the user has not yet locally authenticated 
to a WebISO service, the user will then be redirected to their home 
institution&#39;s authentication system. After the user authenticates, the 
Shibboleth components at the local institution will generate a temporary 
reference to the user, known as a handle, for the individual and send this to 
the target site. The target site can then use the handle to ask for attributes 
about this individual. Based on these attributes, the target can decide whether 
or not to grant access to the resource. The user may then be allowed to access 
the requested materials.</p>
<p>There are several controls on privacy in Shibboleth, and mechanisms are 
provided to allow users to determine exactly which information about them is 
released. A user&#39;s actual identity isn&#39;t necessary for many access control 
decisions, so privacy often is needlessly compromised. Instead, the resource 
often utilizes other attributes such as faculty member or member of a certain 
class. While these are commonly determined using the identity of the user, 
Shibboleth provides a way to mutually refer to the same principal without 
revealing that principal&#39;s identity. Because the user is initially known to the 
target site only by a randomly generated temporary handle, if sufficient, the 
target site might know no more about the user than that the user is a member of 
the origin organization. This handle should never be used to decide whether or 
not to grant access, and is intended only as a temporary reference for 
requesting attributes.</p>
<h4><a name="1.a."></a>1.a. Origin</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>There are four primary components to the origin side in Shibboleth: the 
    Attribute Authority (AA), the Handle Service (HS), the directory service, 
    and the local sign-on system (SSO). The AA and HS are provided with 
    Shibboleth, and an open-source WebISO solution, Pubcookie, can be obtained 
    from www.pubcookie.org; the directory is provided by the origin site. 
    Shibboleth is able to interface with a directory exporting an LDAP interface 
    containing user attributes, and is designed such that programming interfaces 
    to other repositories should be readily implemented. Shibboleth relies on 
    standard web server mechanisms to trigger local authentication. A .htaccess 
    file can be easily used to trigger either the local WebISO system or the web 
    server&#39;s own Basic Auth mechanism, which will likely utilize an enterprise 
    authentication system, such as Kerberos.</p>
    <p>From the origin site&#39;s point of view, the first contact will be the 
    redirection of a user to the handle service, which will then consult the SSO 
    system to determine whether the user has already been authenticated. If not, 
    then the browser user will be asked to authenticate, and then sent back to 
    the target URL with a handle bundled in an attribute assertion. Next, a 
    request from the Shibboleth Attribute Requester (SHAR) will arrive at the AA 
    which will include the previously mentioned handle. The AA then consults the 
    ARP&#39;s for the directory entry corresponding to the handle, queries the 
    directory for these attributes, and releases to the SHAR all attributes the 
    SHAR is entitled to know about that user.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="1.b."></a>1.b. Target</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>There are three primary components to the target side in Shibboleth: the 
    Shibboleth Indexical Reference Establisher (SHIRE), the Shibboleth Attribute 
    Requester (SHAR), and the resource manager (RM). An implementation of each 
    of these is included in the standard Shibboleth distribution. These 
    components are intended to run on the same web server.</p>
    <p>From the target&#39;s point of view, a browser will hit the RM with a request 
    for a Shibboleth-protected resource. The RM then allows the SHIRE to step 
    in, which will use the WAYF to acquire the name of a handle service to ask 
    about the user. The handle service (HS) will then reply with a SAML 
    authentication assertion containing a handle, which the SHIRE then hands off 
    to the SHAR. The SHAR uses the handle and the supplied address of the 
    corresponding attribute authority (AA) to request all attributes it is 
    allowed to know about the handle. The SHAR performs some basic validation 
    and analysis based on attribute acceptance policies (AAP&#39;s). These 
    attributes are then handed off to the RM, which is responsible for using 
    these attributes to decide whether to grant access.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="1.c."></a>1.c. Where are you from? (WAYF)</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>The WAYF service can be either outsourced and operated by a federation or 
    deployed as part of the SHIRE. It is responsible for allowing a user to 
    associate themself with an institution of their specification, then 
    redirecting the user to the known address for the handle service of that 
    institution.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="1.d."></a>1.d. Federations</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>A Shibboleth federation provides part of the underlying trust required 
    for function of the Shibboleth architecture. A federation is a group of 
    organizations(universities, corporations, content providers, etc.) who agree 
    to exchange attributes using the SAML/Shibboleth protocols and abide by a 
    common set of policies and practices. In so doing, they must implicitly or 
    explicitly agree to a common set of guidelines. Joining a federation is not 
    explicitly necessary for operation of Shibboleth, but it dramatically 
    expands the number of targets and origins that can interact without defining 
    bilateral agreements between all these parties.</p>
    <p>A federation can be created in a variety of formats and trust models, but 
    must provide a certain set of services to federation members. It needs to 
    supply a registry to process applications to the federation and distribute 
    membership information to the origin and target sites. This must include 
    distribution of the PKI components necessary for trust between origins and 
    targets. There also needs to be a set of agreements and best practices 
    defined by the federation governing the exchange, use, and population of 
    attributes before and after transit, and there should be a way to find 
    information on local authentication and authorization practices for 
    federation members.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="1.e."></a>1.e. Relying Parties</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Some aspects of both origin and target configuration can vary and be
    expressed in terms of the &quot;relying party&quot;. To an origin, a target
    is a relying party, while targets consider origins to be relying
    parties (it's a matter of perspective). Certificates, policies, and
    other aspects of an interaction are specified on the basis of the relying
    party, and may or may not vary between relying parties depending on the
    deployment's needs.</p>
    <p>Each origin and target is assigned a URI, a unique identifier to enable
    control over configuration down to the level of an individual partner (a single
    relying party). By convention, this is termed a &quot;providerId&quot;. More
    frequently, an entire federation will be viewed by an origin or target as a
    single relying party to simplify management. An individual origin or target
    with which this deployment exchanges information may sometimes be part of
    multiple relying parties if there are multiple trust agreements
    under which these transactions are performed. Care should be taken to avoid
    conflicting or inconsistent configuration in such cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="1.f."></a>1.f. Applications</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Shibboleth &quot;applications&quot; are the primary unit of target
    configuration. Applications as viewed by the target implementation
    are not necessarily defined by the same metrics as in other contexts.  An
    individual application represents a set of web resources that operates
    using the same attribute handling and trust configuration and shares a common
    <a href="#1.g.">session</a> with the browser user. As a user navigates between
    resources on a server that cross an application boundary, a new session is
    established, though user interaction may not be required. As a consequence of
    the relationship between applications and sessions (which are tracked with
    a cookie), an application usually does not span more than one virtual host.
    Apart from cookie-based constraints, web resources can be aggregated into
    applications in arbitrary ways.</p>
    <p>A single target deployment may support a large number of applications,
    but it need not register or publish information about each one with the
    origins it accepts information from. Instead it can communicate using a
    more limited set of distinct &quot;providerId&quot; values (often just a
    single one). This allows targets with a complex internal configuration
    to be treated as a single entity by origins for the purposes of attribute
    release.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="1.g."></a>1.g. Sessions</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Much of the target implementation is concerned with establishing, and
    subsequently maintaining, sessions with the browser user on behalf of the
    <a href="#1.f.">applications</a> at the target. A session consists of a
    cookie passed between the browser and web server, associated with a
    security context. The context contains the user's authentication information,
    and generally a set of attributes that make up the user's identity. Each
    application maintains distinct sessions with the browser by means of separate
    cookies. It is important to note that all such sessions are independent and
    distinct: any session can exist with or without any other session, and the
    expiration of any one session does not imply the expiration of any other
    session.  Shibboleth also does not support any logout functionality beyond the
    termination of individual application sessions by deletion of respective
    cookies; also, there is no way for the target to cause origin-side sessions,
    such as a user's SSO login, to expire.</p>
    <p>A browser user accessing a Shibboleth-protected resource may have two
    outcomes: standard session establishment, and lazy session
    establishment.  The standard session establishment mechanism in which
    Shibboleth protects the resource in all circumstances results in the
    establishment of a cookie-based browser session and a set of attributes
    cached for that application. Shibboleth 1.2 also supports so-called lazy
    session establishment, in which the resource may be accessed without prior
    authentication.  This means the application must be intelligent enough to
    determine whether authentication is necessary, and then construct the proper URL
    to initiate a browser redirect to request authentication; if the
    application determines none is necessary or uses other authorization
    mechanisms, then the request for authentication may not need to be triggered.
    This complex functionality is mostly useful to protect a single URL with
    different access mechanisms, or to require authenticated access only in
    instances where the application deems it necessary.</p>
    <p>Independently of this, a web-based application protected by Shibboleth
    may have a need to establish its own session with the user.  This session
    may persist well beyond the Shibboleth session, and logouts from this
    session, if supported, will not terminate a Shibboleth session initiated to
    access the resource.  Application administrators should carefully evaluate
    the expiration of all sessions to limit vulnerability to attacks or user
    negligence. Logging out of the entire desktop session is usually the
    only (relatively) foolproof logout mechanism on the web.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><a name="2."></a>2. Planning</h3>
<p>There are several essential elements that must be present in the environment 
to ensure Shibboleth functions well, both political and technical. Shibboleth is 
entirely written in Java on the origin side. These are the recommendations and 
requirements for a successful implementation of a Shibboleth origin.</p>
<h4><a name="2.a."></a>2.a. Requirements</h4>
<ul>
    <li>A common institutional directory service should be operational; 
    Shibboleth comes with LDAP capabilities built in, and the Attribute 
    Authority has a Java API which will allow specification of interfaces with 
    legacy directories. This is discussed further in <a href="#4.d.">section 4.d</a>.</li>
    <li>A method to authenticate browser users must be in place, preferably in 
    the form of an enterprise authentication service. Some form of an SSO or a 
    WebISO service is not explicitly necessary for Shibboleth; however, it is 
    highly recommended. Implementation details of this are discussed in
    <a href="#4.c.">section 4.c</a>.</li>
    <li>Shibboleth is known to work on Windows, Linux, and Solaris, but should
    function on any platform that has a Tomcat implementation.</li>
    <li>It is recommended that a web server must be deployed that can host Java 
    servlets and Tomcat, although not explicitly necessary, as Tomcat can still 
    host an origin without it.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="2.b."></a>2.b. Join a Federation</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>While it is not necessary for a target or origin to join a federation, 
    doing so greatly facilitates the implementation of multilateral trust 
    relationships. Each federation will have a different application process. 
    When an origin is accepted into a federation, its information is added to 
    the sites file used by the WAYF and target sites.</p>
    <p>Attribute release and acceptance policies, the use and caching of
    attributes, and definition of commonly traded attributes are examples of
    specifications a federation may make.  <b>The default configuration that
    ships with Shibboleth is intended for use in testing against a <span
    class="fixed">localhost</span> target.  In order to interoperate with other
    relying parties, such as a federation, consult the steps provided by the
    guidelines of that relying party.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="2.c."></a>2.c. Security Considerations</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Shibboleth&#39;s protocols and software have been extensively engineered to 
    provide protection against many attacks. However, the most secure protocol 
    can be compromised if it is placed in an insecure environment. To ensure 
    Shibboleth is as secure as possible, there are several recommended security 
    precautions which should be in place at local sites.</p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>SSL use is optional for origin sites. Federation guidelines should 
        be considered when determining whether to implement SSL, and, in 
        general, SSL should be used for interactions with client machines to 
        provide the necessary authentication and encryption to ensure protection 
        from man-in-the-middle attacks. It is strongly suggested that all 
        password traffic or similarly sensitive data should be SSL-protected. 
        Assessment of the risk tradeoff against possible performance degradation 
        should be performed for all applications.</li>
        <li>Many other attacks can be made on the several redirection steps that 
        Shibboleth takes to complete attribute transfer. The best protection 
        against this is safeguarding the WAYF service and ensuring that rogue 
        targets and origins are not used, generally by development of the trust 
        model underneath Shibboleth. Shibboleth also leverages DNS for security, 
        which is not uncommon, but attacks concerning bad domain information

        <li>Information regarding origin users is generally provided by the 
        authoritative enterprise directory, and the acceptance of requests from 
        target applications can be carefully restricted to ensure that all 
        requests the SHAR performs are authorized and all information the origin 
        provides is accurate. Proper security measures should also be in place 
        on directory access and population(see
        <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/giia/internet2/ldap-recipe/#AccessControl">
        Access Control</a> in the

        recipe</a> for more information). Use of plaintext passwords is strongly 
        advised against.</li>
        <li>Server platforms should be properly secured, commensurate with the 
        level that would be expected for a campus&#39; other security services, and 
        cookie stores on client machines should be well protected.</li>

<h4><a name="2.d."></a>2.d. Server Certs</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>In the Shibboleth architecture, the SHIRE, SHAR, HS, and AA must all have 
    various client and/or server certificates for use in signing assertions and 
    creating SSL channels. These should be issued by a commonly accepted CA, 
    which may be stipulated by some Federation rules. Different federations may 
    require the use of different CA&#39;s.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="2.e."></a>2.e. Attribute Release Policies</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>The Attribute Authority maintains a set of policies called Attribute 
    Release Policies (or ARP&#39;s) that govern the sharing of user attributes with 
    Shibboleth target sites. When a user attempts to access a 
    Shibboleth-protected resource, that resource&#39;s SHAR queries the user&#39;s AA 
    for all attributes to which it is entitled. The SHAR provides its own name 
    and the URL of the resource on behalf of which it is making the request. The 
    AA finds the attributes associated with the browser user, determines an 
    &quot;Effective ARP&quot; for this user, and then sends to the SHAR only the 
    attributes/values allowed in this policy.</p>
    <p>An ARP may be thought of as a sort of filter for outbound attributes; it 
    cannot create attributes or data that aren&#39;t originally present, but it can 
    limit the attributes released and the values those attributes may have when 
    released. It does not change the information in the data sources in any way.</p>
    <p>Each ARP is comprised of one or more rules that specify which attributes 
    and values may be released to a target or set of targets. The assignment of 
    rules to various targets is quite flexible and includes mechanisms for 
    specifying: that a rule should affect all targets (default rule), exact SHAR 
    names for which a rule is applicable, regular expressions against which SHAR 
    names should be matched to determine if a rule is applicable, URL trees for 
    which a rule is applicable.</p>
    <p>For each request, an Effective ARP is determined by locating all ARP&#39;s 
    applicable to the designated user and extracting each rule that matches the 
    querying SHAR and resource. Attributes and values that are specified for 
    release are included in the effective ARP, while those specified for denial 
    are blocked from release. See section <a href="#5.b.i.">5.b.i</a> for 
    details on how ARP&#39;s are processed.</p>
    <p>Various ARP&#39;s may be combined in forming the Effective ARP. For instance, 
    the Site ARP is administratively maintained and applies to all users for 
    which the AA is answerable. User ARP&#39;s apply to a specific user only, and 
    can be maintained either administratively or by the users themselves. All 
    ARP&#39;s are specified using the same syntax and semantics.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="2.f."></a>2.f. Designate Contacts</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Since Shibboleth deals both with daily technical and operational issues 
    and also with contractual issues, a set of contacts should be set up to 
    support the user base and to facilitate interactions with other Shibboleth 
    sites and federation members. It is recommended that at least technical and 
    administrative contacts be designated.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="2.g."></a>2.g. Browser Requirements</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>A primary Shibboleth design consideration was to require very little or 
    no modification to client machines. The only requirement is that a browser 
    is used which supports cookies, redirection and SSL. Browser users will have 
    to perform an additional click to submit the authentication assertion if 
    JavaScript is not functional.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="2.h."></a>2.h. Clocks</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p><a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/">NTP</a> should be run on all 
    web servers. Shibboleth employs a short handle issuance time to protect 
    against replay attacks. Because of this, any significant degree of clock 
    skew can hinder the ability of users to access sites successfully.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="2.i."></a>2.i. Other Considerations</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Especially for higher education, there are a handful of laws enacted 
    which may have important ramifications on the disclosure of personal 
    information and attributes. Since Shibboleth does not necessarily need to 
    transmit identity, it is an ideal solution for many higher education 
    situations. Nevertheless, all parties within the United States of America 
    are strongly advised to consult the
    <a href="http://www.ed.gov/offices/OM/fpco/ferpa/">Family Educational Rights 
    and Privacy Act of 1974(FERPA)</a>, and all other relevant state and federal 
    legislation before deploying Shibboleth.</p>

        <li>The archive will expand into a <span class="fixed">
        shibboleth-origin-1.2/</span> directory(<span class="fixed">/opt/</span>

        </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>Tomcat 4.1.x requires that several Java jarfiles used by Shibboleth 
        be located in a special &quot;endorsed&quot; folder to override obsolete classes 
        that Sun includes with their JVM. To deal with this problem use the 
        following command, adjusting paths as needed:<blockquote>
            <p><span class="fixed">$ cp 
            /opt/shibboleth-origin-1.2/endorsed/*.jar /usr/local/tomcat/common/endorsed</span>

        </blockquote>
        <p>Different versions of Tomcat or other Java servers may have other 
        locations in which to place these files or deal with this problem. Refer 
        to your application server&#39;s documentation to find out how to properly 
        endorse classes, if necessary.</li>
        <li>Restart Tomcat, which will automatically detect that there has been 
        a new .war file added. This file will by default be expanded into
        <span class="fixed">/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/shibboleth</span>.</li>
        <li>Apache must be told to map the URL&#39;s for the Shibboleth HS and AA to 
        Tomcat. Two popular ways of doing this are to include the following text 
        directly in <span class="fixed">httpd.conf</span>, or to place
        <span class="fixed">Include conf/mod_jk.conf</span> in
        <span class="fixed">httpd.conf</span>, and place the following

        <li>Tomcat&#39;s <span class="fixed">/conf/server.xml</span> ships by 
        default with the Coyote/JK2 connector enabled, which fails with 
        Shibboleth due to the lack of support for <span class="fixed">
        REMOTE_USER</span>. This connector must be commented out. Then, 
        uncomment and modify the traditional AJP 1.3 connector as follows:<ol type="A">
            <li>Add <span class="fixed">address=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;</span> inside

            configuration element to ensure that the user&#39;s identity is passed 
            from Apache to the servlet environment.</li>
            <li>The AJP13Connector for tomcat is not compatible with the new JMX support.  To remove some warnings that will  appear in the tomcat log every time tomcat is restarted, comment out all of the JMX stuff (anything that says "mbeans") from server.xml.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>It is <b>strongly</b> recommended that the AA be SSL-protected to

<h4><a name="4.a.i"></a>4.a.i Modifying the default Attribute Resolver 
configuration</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>The resolver.xml file controls the retrieval of attributes from 
    enterprise repositories, and the process of mapping them to Shibboleth/SAML 
    attributes. For more precise information regarding how attributes are 
    processed or syntactically formed, please refer to section <a href="#5.d.">
    5.d.</a></p>
    <p>In order to make the Shibboleth software operational, however, minor 
    edits must be made to the example version of the resolver.xml file. The file 
    can be found at <span class="fixed">/webapps/shibboleth/WEB-INF/classes/conf/resolver.xml.</span> 
    Two changes are necessary:</p>
    <p>1. The value of the smartScope attribute should be changed to the Domain 
    Name value submitted to the Federation. It appears on two 
    SimpleAttributeDefinition elements: eduPersonScopedAffiliation and 
    eduPersonPrincipalName.</p>
    <p>2. The comment indicators should be removed from around the definitions 
    of those two elements ( &lt;!-- and --&gt; ).</p>
</blockquote>

</p>
<h4><a name="4.b."></a>4.b. Key Generation and Certificate Installation</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>The SAML messages generated by the HS must be digitally signed, which
    requires the HS be issued a private key and corresponding certificate.  In
    most instances, the web server will be configured to use SSL, which will
    also require a cert/key pair.  In many cases, these certs/keys can be shared
    between Apache/IIS and the HS; for information on sharing certificate/key
    pairs between Apache and Java keystores see section <a
    href="#5.c.">5.c.</a>.  Sharing credentials is simplest when using flat-file
    unencrypted PEM-format certs/keys as expected by Apache.</p>

    <p>The 1.2 origin accommodates keys and certificates in a very wide variety
    of formats and storage mechanisms.  Java keystores may be specified in a <a
    href="#confKeyStoreResolver"><span class="fixed">KeyStoreResolver</span></a>
    element or flat-file keys and certificates may be specified using a <a
    href="#confFileResolver"><span class="fixed">FileResolver</span></a> in <a
    href="#5.a."><span class="fixed">origin.xml</span></a>.  The information in
    that file must be consistent with the values that are established in this
    process.</p>

    <p>The following text suggests a way to generate a key and certificate in
    flat-file PEM format, which will be simplest for most deployments.  Once the
    key pair is generated, the public key must be sent to a certificate
    authority recognized by relying parties with which this origin will interact
    to be signed into a certificate. OpenSSL must be installed to perform this
    process.</p>

    <p>The certificate and key file location should be based on whether they
    will also be used for Apache.  If they will be used as a server certificate
    as well, they should probably be in the Apache tree in the usual <span
    class="fixed">mod_ssl</span>-defined locations inside the Apache
    configuration folder.  If the certificate and key will only be used by
    Shibboleth, they can be put in the same folder with the <span
    class="fixed">origin.xml</span> file and protected appropriately.</p>

    <p>OpenSSL commands to generate a new keypair and a certificate request are
    shown here, assuming 2048 bit RSA keys are to be used:</p>

    <blockquote><span class="fixed"> $ openssl genrsa -des3 -out ssl.key
    2048<br> $ openssl req -new -key ssl.key -out ssl.csr </span></blockquote>

    <p>The signed certificate file returned by the CA should be usable directly,
    or can be converted to PEM format using the <span class="fixed">openssl
    x509</span> command.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="4.c."></a>4.c. Linking the Authentication System to the HS</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>The interaction between the HS and the local authentication system is 
    implemented by supplying the HS with the identity of the browser user. Most 
    often, this will mean protecting the HS servlet with some form of local 
    authentication that populates <span class="fixed">REMOTE_USER</span>. 
    Location blocks can be added to <span class="fixed">httpd.conf</span>, 
    associating the appropriate authentication mechanism with the URL of the HS 
    servlet. The following example demonstrates association of a very basic 
    authentication method with the HS:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="fixed">&lt;Location /shibboleth/HS&gt;<br>
        AuthType Basic<br>
        AuthName &quot;Internet2 Handle Service&quot;<br>
        AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/conf/user.db<br>
        require valid-user<br>
        &lt;/Location&gt;<br>
        </span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Note that .htaccess files cannot be used for this purpose because URL&#39;s 
    are &quot;virtualized&quot; by Tomcat.</p>
    <p>It is recommended that the origin be tested at the end of this process 
    using the process described in section <a href="#6.a.">6.a</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="4.c.i."></a>4.c.i. Enabling client certificate authentication
<font color="#5555EE">(optional)</font></h4>
<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Shibboleth supports client certificate authentication by utilization 
        of a filter that relies on the web server to do all processing to ensure 
        that the certificate is both valid and appropriate for the application. 
        An example deployment descriptor is included with the Shibboleth 
        distribution at <span class="fixed">$SHIB_HOME/webAppConfig/origin-client-cert.xml</span>. 
        To enable the filter, add the following to the deployment descriptor (<span class="fixed">web.xml</span>):</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><span class="fixed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;filter&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;filter-name&gt;<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/filter-name&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;filter-class&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edu.internet2.middleware.shibboleth.utils.ClientCertTrustFilter<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/filter-class&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/filter&gt;<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;filter-mapping&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;filter-name&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Client Cert AuthN Filter<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/filter-name&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;url-pattern&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/HS<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/url-pattern&gt;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/filter-mapping&gt;<br>
            </span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>By default, the filter pulls the principal name out of the
        <span class="fixed">CN</span> of the cert&#39;s
        <span class="fixed">Subject</span> by using regular expression 
        grouping. This may be done using patterns such as:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><span class="fixed">regex: &#39;.*CN=([^,/]+).*&#39; match group: 1</span>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The servlet filter will accept two initialization parameters,
        <span class="fixed">regex</span> and <span class="fixed">
        matchGroup</span> that can be used to extract the principal name 
        differently.</p>

<h4><a name="4.d."></a>4.d. Establishing default ARP&#39;s for the origin community</h4>
<p><b>For a more basic introduction to ARP&#39;s, please refer to section
<a href="#2.e.">2.e</a>.</b></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>An ARP determines which attributes are released to a SHAR when a user 
    tries to access a resource. It acts as a sort of filter on user information 
    contained in the authoritative directory, deciding what can be released to 
    whom, but not modifying or creating information itself. ARP&#39;s are generally 
    administered by the site, but Shibboleth will provide for users to broker 
    control of their own information and privacy by allowing them to create 
    ARP&#39;s pertaining to themselves.</p>
    <p>It is recommended that a set of policies be established between an origin 
    and frequently accessed targets to specify default releases of expected 
    attributes. Federation guidelines may provide more information on population 
    of ARP&#39;s.</p>
    <p>Currently, there is no direct mechanism for users to create their own 
    ARP&#39;s besides direct XML writing. In future versions, a GUI will be provided 
    for simpler management of ARP&#39;s. Care should be given to balancing giving 
    sufficient control over information to users and avoiding access problems. 
    For example, users may decide to restrict the release of their personal 
    information to such a degree that access to a site for a class may become 
    impossible because Shibboleth cannot release enough information to grant 
    access.</p>
    <p>The Shibboleth distribution contains an example site arp that releases 
    the eduPersonScopedAffiliation attribute to all targets. For more precise 
    information regarding how ARP&#39;s are processed or syntactically formed, 
    please refer to section <a href="#5.b.i.">5.b.i</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="4.e."></a>4.e. <span class="fixed">metadatatool</span></h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>The Shibboleth origin leverages metadata distributed by relying parties and federations to validate the identity of requesters and the resource providers on whose behalf the request is being made.  This metadata is cached locally in the form of <span class="fixed">sites.xml</span> files.  Shibboleth includes a simple utility called <span class="fixed">metadatatool</span> which can be used to refresh a <span class="fixed">sites.xml</span> file.  These files are then pointed to by <a href="#confFederationProvider"><span class="fixed">FederationProvider</span></a> elements in <a href="#5.a."><span class="fixed">shibboleth.xml</span></a>.</p>
<p>The following command is appropriate for most deployments and is run from the $SHIB_HOME directory.  This should be frequently run by adding it to a <span class="fixed">crontab</span> to ensure that the data is fresh.</p>

<blockquote><span class="fixed">bin/metadatatool -i https://wayf.internet2.edu/InQueue/sites.xml -k conf/internet2.jks -p shib123 -a sitesigner -o /your_path_here/sites.xml</span></blockquote>

<p>This is a list of all the command-line parameters that may be specified:</p>

<blockquote><span class="fixed">when signing:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-i &lt;uri&gt; -s -k &lt;keystore&gt; -a &lt;alias&gt; -p &lt;pass&gt; [-o

</span></blockquote>
    <p>Shibboleth 1.2 still utilizes <span class="fixed">mod_ssl</span> for verification of certificates presented by SHAR's when processing attribute requests.  This requires an updated <span class="fixed">ca-bundle.crt</span> to ensure that all appropriate certificate authorities used by relying parties are recognized.</p>

    <p>Shibboleth 1.2 origins are configured using the <span
    class="fixed">origin.xml</span> file located in <span
    class="fixed">/webapps/shibboleth/WEB-INF/classes/conf/origin.xml</span>. 
    The XML consists of a set of individual elements that describe how the
    origin should operate, which may each have their own attributes or appear
    within other elements.  This structure is represented through
    cross-references in the definitions and the examples presented in <a

    class="fixed">origin.xml</span> file which contains all possible
    configuration parameters and values. The configuration must be consistent
    with values elsewhere in the deployment or access errors may occur.  For a
    more basic example, consult <a href="#4.a.">section 4.a</a>.  This is useful

        user&#39;s personal LDAP entry, and the site ARP would be an attribute
        of an entry representing the site. While not performed by the built-in
        ARP repository, a repository implementation might also implement group
        ARP&#39;s; for example, in an LDAP directory, the user entry might have
        some group membership attributes that refer to group entries, and those
        group entries would have ARP attributes, and all those ARP&#39;s would
        be applicable.</p></dd>

<h4><a name="5.b."></a>5.b. ARP Overview</h4>
<blockquote>
    <h5>This section applies primarily to the syntactic and technical details of 
    ARP&#39;s. For basic information on and explanation of what an ARP is and how it 
    should be managed, please refer to sections <a href="#2.e.">2.e</a> and
    <a href="#4.d.">4.d</a>.</h5>
    <p>Every ARP file contains one ARP. ARP&#39;s may be specified either as the 
    site ARP or user ARP&#39;s. The site ARP pertains to every principal for whom 
    the AA retrieves information; a user ARP applies only to the individual user 
    for whom it is defined. The set of principals to whom the ARP applies is 
    defined by the name of the ARP file: the site ARP is stored in
    <span class="fixed">arp.site.xml</span> and user ARP&#39;s are stored as
    <span class="fixed">arp.user.$PRINCIPALNAME.xml</span>. Up to two ARP&#39;s 
    will apply to a principal: the site ARP, and the user ARP for that 
    principal.</p>
    <p>Each ARP acts as a container that holds a set of ARP rules that are
    applicable to the principals that ARP is effective for. Each ARP rule
    specifies a single release policy within the ARP container pertaining to a
    particular target application.  For 1.2 targets, this is a single URI
    matching a <span class="fixed">providerId</span>.  Prior to 1.2, URI's for
    targets were not registered; this means that the SHAR name must be used in
    release policies for 1.1 targets accessed by users from this origin.  Each
    ARP rule may contain specifications regarding the release of any number of
    attribute values to requests matching that ARP rule for that user. ARP rules
    may be flagged as default, implying that they are always applied to any user
    matched by the ARP container. Note that ARP&#39;s may also be used to
    restrict specific attribute/value pairs in addition to restricting or
    releasing individual attributes.</p>
    <p>When a query is received, the AA generates an effective ARP, which is the 
    fully evaluated set of ARP rules regarding that relying party based on all ARP 
    containers applicable to the principal. This effective ARP is then applied 
    to attribute values retrieved from the directory and the appropriate 
    assertion is constructed. Default rules are always included in construction 
    of the effective ARP.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="5.b.i."></a>5.b.i. ARP Processing</h4>
<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>When a request arrives from a particular relying party, the applicable set of 
        ARP rules are parsed into an effective ARP. This parsing is done as 
        follows:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Identify all ARP&#39;s that should be applied to a particular 
            principal. This is done by isolating the files in the folder 
            specified by the <a href="#confArpRepository"><span class="fixed">ArpRepository</span></a> element 
            that have the name either arp.site.xml or 
            arp.user.$PRINCIPALNAME.xml.</li>
            <li>Find all ARP rules relevant to the query:
            <ol type="i">
                <li>Any ARP rules within the identified ARP&#39;s designated as 
                defaults are automatically included in the effective ARP without 
                performing any matching functions.</li>
                <li>For each non-default rule in each identified ARP, the 
                matching functions specified in the rule&#39;s target definition are 
                performed. A separate matching function is performed for the 
                requesting SHAR and the providerId on behalf of which the SHAR is 
                making the request.</li>
                <li>Each matching function evaluates to <span class="fixed">
                TRUE</span> if the match is successful or
                <span class="fixed">FALSE</span> if it is unsuccessful. If 
                both functions evaluate to <span class="fixed">TRUE</span>, 
                the rule is included in the Effective ARP.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Construct the Attribute Filter:
            <ol type="i">
                <li>For each attribute, compile a temporary list of associated 
                rules that includes all values with a release qualifier of
                <span class="fixed">permit</span>.</li>
                <li>Subtract from this list all attribute values with rules 
                specifying a release qualifier of <span class="fixed">deny</span>. 
                The resulting list represents the allowable release values for 
                the attribute and is used as a mask for the values which are 
                returned from the Attribute Resolver.</li>
                <li>If a statement specifies that all values should be 
                permitted, then specific <span class="fixed">deny</span> 
                qualifiers for specific values should still be enforced. If a 
                statement specifies that all values should be denied, then
                <span class="fixed">permit</span> qualifiers for specific 
                values will be ignored.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Using the mask and attributes returned from the Attribute 
            Resolver, an assertion is constructed.</li>

<h4><a name="5.b.ii."></a>5.b.ii. ARP Syntax</h4>
<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Each ARP is described by an XML file based on a standard
        <span class="fixed">.xsd</span> schema. It consists of a standard
        <span class="fixed">AttributeReleasePolicy</span> element 
        referencing the appropriate <span class="fixed">xsi:schemaLocation</span> 
        and a self-explanatory <span class="fixed">Description</span> 
        element followed by any number of <span class="fixed">Rule</span> 
        elements. Each <span class="fixed">Rule</span> element must consist 
        of a <span class="fixed">Target</span> element and one or more
        <span class="fixed">Attribute</span> elements. The
        <span class="fixed">Target</span> element specifies the rules by 
        which the target definition is formed. The <span class="fixed">
        Attribute</span> elements specifies the name and values of the 
        attributes that may be released.</p>
        <p>The simplest possible ARP is as follows, which releases

        </blockquote>

    <p>All ARP&#39;s must take the same basic form. A detailed description of how 
    each element of the <span class="fixed">Rule</span> element may be 
    sub-populated follows:</p>
    <p>The <span class="fixed">Target</span> element:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="fixed">Target</span> may contain either the
        <span class="fixed">AnyTarget</span> element, which will cause the
        <span class="fixed">Target</span> to always return
        <span class="fixed">TRUE</span>, or both the
        <span class="fixed">Requester</span> element, which provides for 
        matches to be performed against the SHAR name for 1.1 targets or the <span class="fixed">providerId</span> for 1.2 targets, and the
        <span class="fixed">Resource</span> element, which provides for 
        matches to be performed against the requested URL.</p>
        <p>When going against 1.1 targets, the <span
        class="fixed">Resource</span> element will refer to individual URL trees
        protected by a given SHAR.  However, due to the nature of application
        identifiers, the <span class="fixed">Resource</span> element has no
        meaning when releasing to 1.2 targets.  These will always function as
        though <span class="fixed">&lt;AnyResource/&gt;</span> is specified,
        making the entire <span class="fixed">Resource</span> element necessary
        only if this origin will be applying this ARP to 1.1 targets.</p>
        <p>There are three matches that may be performed by the AA in evaluating 
        ARP&#39;s by using the <span class="fixed">matchFunction</span> 
        component of the <span class="fixed">Requester</span> and
        <span class="fixed">Resource</span> elements. The following match 
        patterns may be specified directly following the
        <span class="fixed">Requester</span> or <span class="fixed">
        Resource</span> elements, such as <span class="fixed">&lt;Requester 
        matchFunction=&quot;urn:mace:shibboleth:arp:matchFunction:regexMatch&quot;&gt;</span>:</p>

                string content of the <span class="fixed">Requester</span> 
                element matches exactly the providerId of the requesting application of 1.2 targets or the SHAR name of 1.1 targets. 
                Otherwise evaluates to <span class="fixed">FALSE</span>. 
                Serves as the default value associated with
                <span class="fixed">Requester</span> if none is specified.</p>

                name of the requesting SHAR for or the requested URL tree for 1.1 targets is a valid 
                match of the regular expression represented as the content of 
                the containing element. Otherwise evaluates to

    <p>The <span class="fixed">Attribute</span> element:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The <span class="fixed">Attribute</span> element must always 
        specify the URN of the attribute whose release parameters it specifies. 
        Additionally, it must contain either the <span class="fixed">
        AnyValue</span> element or one or more <span class="fixed">Value</span> 
        elements. These elements, in turn, must specify either
        <span class="fixed">release</span> = <span class="fixed">

        or export private key information, making it difficult to use the same 
        private key and certificate for Apache and Java-based applications. The 
        Shibboleth distribution includes <span class="fixed">extkeytool</span>, 
        a program that can be used in conjunction with <span class="fixed">
        keytool</span> to perform these tasks. Select the appropriate 
        step-by-step procedure for your situation from the following guides.</p>
        <p>Before running <span class="fixed">extkeytool</span>, the 
        variable SHIB_HOME must be set to the path to the directory where the 
        Shibboleth tarball was exploded(typically /opt/shibboleth-origin-1.2/).</p>

<h4><a name="5.d."></a>5.d. The Attribute Resolver</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Shibboleth provides a powerful attribute resolver that allows origins to 
    quickly configure the retrieval of simple attributes from standard types of 
    attribute stores. The resolver is configured using an xml file wich should 
    be pointed to with the <span class="fixed">
    edu.internet2.middleware.shibboleth.aa. 
    attrresolv.AttributeResolver.ResolverConfig</span> propety in
    <span class="fixed">origin.xml</span> as described in section
    <a href="#4.a.">4.a</a>. For more complex attributes or those that require 
    processing before release, customized Java classes will need to be written. 
    For more information, consult the programmer&#39;s guide.</p>
    <p>The resolver is essentially a directed graph from attribute definitions 
    to data connectors. The data connectors pull data, in the form of 
    attributes, from external data sources. The attribute definitions then 
    process this data into a from suitable for use by Shibboleth. This procedure 
    can be as simple as taking an unmodified string value from a data connector 
    and tagging it with a name or can include arbitrarily complex business 
    rules.</p>
    <p>The <span class="fixed">resolver.xml</span> file that is pointed to 
    by <span class="fixed">origin.xml</span> consists of zero or 
    more attribute definitions followed by zero or more data connectors. Each 
    attribute definition consists of an identifier corresponding to the URN of 
    the attribute, and optional references to data connectors on which it 
    depends. Each data connector consists of a string identifier which is used 
    by attribute definitions that refer to it, and one or more elements specific 
    to the configuration of that data connector.</p>
    <p>Shibboleth comes with two attribute definitions provided in version 1.2: 
    the <span class="fixed">SimpleAttributeDefinition</span>, which acts as 
    a basic proxy for attributes supplied by data connectors with some name 
    conversion and attribute scoping added, and a <span class="fixed">
    CustomAttributeDefinition</span>, which can be used to configure 
    user-created attribute definition plugins. Similarly, Shibboleth 1.2 comes 
    with two data connectors: the <span class="fixed">
    JNDIDirectoryDataConnector</span>, which pulls data from any source for 
    which there is a JNDI Directory Context implementation, including LDAP, NDS, 
    etc., and the <span class="fixed">CustomDataConnector</span>, which is 
    used to configure user-created data connector plugins.</p>
    <p>A detailed explanation of each configuration option for the provided 
    connectors follows:</p>
    <p><span class="fixed">JNDIDirectoryDataConnector</span>:</p>

    applicable ARP&#39;s. Although it does show the attributes generated by the 
    resolver for a particular user or URL, it does not necessarily reflect what 
    will be released by the AA to a requesting SHAR.</h5>

<h4><a name="5.e."></a>5.e. Local Error Page</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Origin sites are encouraged to provide federations with the URL of a 
    local Shibboleth error page. If a browser user from the origin site 
    encounters a problem at a shibbolized target, the target is likely to 
    display an error page that includes a link back to this origin provided 
    page.</p>
    <p>The page should provide information on how to obtain local support for 
    using Shibbolized resources. It might also include suggestions on what 
    information should be recorded before beginning the problem resolution 
    process.</p>

<h4><a name="5.f."></a>5.f. Using a New Attribute</h4>
<p>In order for an attribute to be sent to a target, two steps are required:</p>
<p>1. The attribute has to be defined in resolver.xml. See section <a href="#5.d.">5.d</a>.</p>
<p>2. The effective ARP for that target has to release this attribute value. See section <a href="#5.b.">5.b.</a>.</p>
<p>Note: resolvertest is a useful tool for verifying the correctness of the definitions.</p>
<p>Note: the AAP at the target must also define this attribute. See the Shibboleth Target Deploy Guide.</p>

<h3><a name="6."></a>6. Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>This section provides basic information about testing, logging, and error 
handling for Shibboleth origins. This information is not intended to be 
comprehensive, but instead rudimentary guidelines for basic configuration tests 
and problems. For more detailed information or answers to specific problems not 
addressed in this section, please mail
<a href="mailto:shibboleth-users@internet2.edu">shibboleth-users@internet2.edu</a> 
with a thorough description of errors and configurations used.</p>
<h4><a name="6.a."></a>6.a. Basic Testing</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Internet2 provides a basic target that can be used to test origin setup 
    functionality. After your origin is recognized by InQueue, simply use any 
    browser to access <a href="https://wayf.internet2.edu/InQueue/sample.jsp">
    https://wayf.internet2.edu/InQueue/sample.jsp</a>. Select your origin&#39;s name 
    and follow the login process as a user would. Note that SSL must be used, 
    and both the HS and AA must be fully configured.</p>
    <p>The test target will then display a simple page which includes the basic 
    information sent to it by your origin and the authentication rules it is 
    using.</p>
    <p><b>For information regarding specific error messages that may be 
    generated if the origin does not work successfully, please refer to section
    <a href="#6.c.">6.c</a>.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="6.b."></a>6.b. Logging</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>Shibboleth&#39;s origin components log various operations which may prove 
    useful for auditing, testing, and security purposes. This data is sent 
    through <span class="fixed">log4j</span>&#39;s standard mechanism. The 
    location of the log file, the level at which the log is output, the 
    formatting of the logs, and many more options may be configured by editing
    <span class="fixed">/WEB-INF/classes/conf/log4j.properties</span>. By 
    default, it is setup to log to the console of the servlet container, with a 
    level of <span class="fixed">WARN</span>, but there is also a commented 
    out example in the file to give a possible alternate configuration.</p>
