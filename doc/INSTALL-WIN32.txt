This release works with SAML library version "5".

Please read the README.txt and INSTALL.txt files in the same directory
with this file before continuing. More general information is available
there. This file documents the particulars of building from source on
Windows NT/2000/XP.

Visual C++ 6.0 on Windows is currently supported. The Shibboleth.dsw workspace
file is located in the root of the distribution.

You'll need to indicate to the compiler where the OpenSAML include and
library files are. Using the global directory settings is the easiest way.

You can choose which, if any, web server modules to build, in case you don't
need or want one or more of them.

To build the MySQL cache plugin, a fairly customized build of MySQL is required,
which we haven't fully documented. At a minimum, you must build from source using
the MySQL Visual C++ workspace, the projects must all be modified to use the
DLL C/C++ runtime, and the USE_TLS macro must be defined for the projects. If you
need specifics, ask for help.

For more information about Windows builds, please read the OpenSAML
INSTALL-WIN32.txt file.
