Please read the README.txt and INSTALL.txt files in the same directory
with this file before continuing. More general information is available
there. This file documents the particulars of building from source on
Windows NT/2000/XP.

Visual C++ 6.0 on Windows is currently supported. The Shibboleth.dsw workspace
file is located in the root of the distribution.

You'll need to indicate to the compiler where the OpenSAML include and
library files are. Using the global directory settings is the easiest way.

You can choose which, if any, web server modules to build, in case you don't
need or want one or more of them.

For more information about Windows builds, please read the OpenSAML
INSTALL-WIN32.txt file.
