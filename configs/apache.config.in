# Load the Shibboleth module.

LoadModule mod_shib @-LIBEXECDIR-@/mod_shib_13.so

#
# Global Configuration
# This is the XML file that contains all the global, non-apache-specific
# configuration.  Look at this file for most of your configuration parameters.

ShibSchemaDir @-PKGXMLDIR-@
ShibConfig @-PKGSYSCONFDIR-@/shibboleth.xml

# An Apache handler needs to be established for the "handler" location.
# This applies the handler to any requests for a resource with a ".sso"
# extension.
#
<Files *.sso>
SetHandler shib-handler
</Files>
#
# Another way of addressing this is to apply Shibboleth
# globally to the site in "lazy" session mode:
# <Location />
# AuthType shibboleth
# require shibboleth
# </Location>

#
# Used for example logo and style sheet in error templates.
#
<IfModule mod_alias.c>
  Alias /shibboleth-sp/main.css @-PKGDOCDIR-@/main.css
  Alias /shibboleth-sp/logo.jpg @-PKGDOCDIR-@/logo.jpg
</IfModule>

#
# Configure the module for content
#
# You can now do most of this in shibboleth.xml using the RequestMap
# but you MUST enable AuthType shibboleth for the module to process
# any requests, and there MUST be a require command as well. To
# enable Shibboleth but not specify any session/access requirements
# use "require shibboleth".
#
<Location /secure>
  AuthType shibboleth
  ShibRequireSession On
  require valid-user
</Location>
